    <h1>the tragic tale of tiddlls</h1>
    <p id="story">
        once there was a turtle named tiddlls. he had one dream: cross the road and reach the great lettuce patch.
        he took one step. a car swerved and hit a mailbox. tiddlls took another step. another car swerved, hit a fruit stand. 
        tiddlls ate an orange slice. soon, a traffic jam formed. helicopters arrived. the news called him "unstoppable road goblin."
        tiddlls did not know what that meant. he just wanted lettuce. then—betrayal. a child picked him up. 
        "omg a turtle!!!" tiddlls was airborne. he had never been airborne. he was placed in a tank. there was lettuce. 
        unlimited lettuce. but tiddlls only stared at the road he would never cross. he let out the slowest, saddest sigh in turtle history.
